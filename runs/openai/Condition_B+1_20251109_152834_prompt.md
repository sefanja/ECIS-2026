## Your Task: Analyze, Correct, and Regenerate

1. **Analyze the Violations:** For each violation in the report, use the provided `Statement` and `Rationale` to understand the nature of the logical error.
2. **Correct the Model:** Modify the elements, relationships, and hierarchies in the model to resolve all identified violations. You must determine the most logical way to correct the model based on your understanding of the rules.
3. **Generate the Final Output:** Provide the **full, corrected version** of all three CSV files (`elements.csv`, `relations.csv`, `properties.csv`).

---

### Final Output Requirements

Before generating the final CSV files, you **must** ensure the following format requirements are met:

* **Content Completeness:** The `Documentation` column for **every single element** in `elements.csv` must be filled with a concise, meaningful description.
* **Format Adherence:**
  * The `Type` column in `elements.csv` may **only** contain one of the three allowed values: `ValueStream`, `Capability`, or `BusinessObject`.
  * The `Type` column in `relations.csv` may **only** contain one of the three allowed values: `CompositionRelationship`, `ServingRelationship`, or `AssociationRelationship`.

```
