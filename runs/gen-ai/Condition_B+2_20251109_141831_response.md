# Raw LLM Response for Condition_B+2

Based on my analysis of the validation report, I have identified and corrected all architectural violations. The primary issues involved incorrect relationship levels, missing associations, and a structural misalignment where Level 1 capabilities were serving multiple value stream stages, sometimes across different top-level value streams.

To resolve these issues, I have performed the following corrections:
1.  **Corrected Relationship Scoping:** The `ServingRelationship` from `Student Record Management` (C2_SRM) was retargeted from the Level 1 value stream `Graduate & Confer Degree` (V1_DE4) to its appropriate Level 2 child, `Audit & Confer Degree` (V2_DE41). This resolves the upward/downward coherence (C4, C5) and traceability (C9) violations.
2.  **Resolved Object Relevance:** An `AssociationRelationship` was added from the `Intellectual Property Management` capability (C2_IPM) to the `Technology License Agreement` business object (O2_TLA), ensuring the object is managed by a capability and fixing the C7 violation.
3.  **Refactored Level 1 Capabilities:** To fix the C10 violations, the Level 1 capabilities were significantly refactored to create a clear, one-to-one alignment with their corresponding Level 1 value stream stages. This involved replacing the overly broad capabilities (`C1_CPD`, `C1_REE`, `C1_RFD`, `C1_SEA`) with new, more focused capabilities, and re-assigning their children and relationships accordingly.

The following files represent the complete and corrected version of the architectural model.
