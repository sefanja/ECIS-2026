----------------------------------------------------------------------

[!!] C3 - Consistent refinement depth: 14/42 (33.33%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: All leaf elements (elements without children) must have the same number of ancestors.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - value-stream: Define Research Strategy
   - value-stream: Establish Research Infrastructure
   - value-stream: Foster Research Culture
   - value-stream: Analyze Needs
   - value-stream: Design Program

[!!] C4 - Upward coherence: 26/30 (86.67%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A non-hierarchical relationship between two elements requires a corresponding relationship between their parents (if any), provided the parents are distinct and with one exception: the relationship does not need to be propagated if the parent elements are both primary capabilities within the same top-level value stream.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Curriculum & Program Development) --> (Approve & Implement Program)
   - serving-relationship: (Research Dissemination & Impact) --> (Disseminate Results)
   - serving-relationship: (Research Strategy & Portfolio Management) --> (Foster Research Culture)
   - serving-relationship: (Student Recruitment & Admissions) --> (Recruit & Admit Student)
   - serving-relationship: (Teaching & Learning Delivery) --> (Advise & Support)

[!!] C5 - Downward coherence: 22/24 (91.67%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Statement: A relationship between two parent elements requires that at least one pair of their respective children (if any) is also related.
 * Examples of violating items: 
   - serving-relationship: (Curriculum & Program Development) --> (Approve & Implement Program)
   - serving-relationship: (Research Dissemination & Impact) --> (Disseminate Results)
   - serving-relationship: (Research Strategy & Portfolio Management) --> (Foster Research Culture)
   - serving-relationship: (Student Recruitment & Admissions) --> (Recruit & Admit Student)
   - serving-relationship: (Teaching & Learning Delivery) --> (Advise & Support)

[!!] C6 - Capability Impact: 18/26 (69.23%)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
