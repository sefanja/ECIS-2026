**Sector to be Analyzed:** <!-- ENTER SECTOR NAME -->

* **Core Purpose & Societal Role:** Describe the sector's fundamental purpose. Why does it exist? What societal need does it fulfill?
* **Primary Business Model Archetype(s):** Identify the dominant business model. Think in terms of B2C (to consumers), B2B (to businesses), B2G (to government), or non-profit/public funding. A hybrid model is possible.
* **Key Strategic Drivers & Basis of Competition:** On what basis do organizations in this sector compete? Consider factors like reputation, innovation, efficiency, customer satisfaction, or societal impact. Name the 2-3 most important ones.
* **Dominant Environmental Factors:** Describe the context in which the sector operates. Consider laws and regulations, public accountability, technological trends, or funding models (e.g., public funds).
