1. **Define L0 Value Streams using CODP:** Based on the customer segments and their value propositions identified eralier, define the complete set of L0 `ValueStreams`.
   * **Principle:** If the organization creates a standardized, reusable business asset 'to stock' (**Make-to-Stock, MTS**), this is a separate L0 `ValueStream`. The flow triggered by a customer order (**Assemble-to-Order, ATO**) is another.
   * **Litmus Test:** Ask "Does the organization build a core asset *before* any specific customer is known?"
     * **Example:** A software company develops a standard `Platform` (MTS) before a client signs up. Configuring that platform for a new client (ATO) is a separate L0 Value Stream.
   * **Action:** Use this logic to define all internal asset-creation streams (MTS) and all customer-facing delivery streams (ATO/ETO).
2. **Characterize All Value Streams:** For every L0 `ValueStream` defined above:
    * Assign a `Value Stream Pattern (CODP)`: Choose one of `ETO`, `ATO`, or `MTS`.
    * Use the 'deepest' pattern (`ETO` > `ATO` > `MTS`) that represents a typical case for the sector.
3. Present the result as a list: `[L0 Value Stream Name, Description, Originating VP, Value Stream Pattern]`.
